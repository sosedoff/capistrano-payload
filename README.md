# Capistrano Payload

Capistrano plugin that delivers JSON-encoded deployment information via POST to the URL of your choice.

## Installation

    gem install capistrano-payload
    
## Usage

Add payload plugin into your deploy.rb file:

    require 'capistrano-payload'
    
Then configure URL:

    set :payload_url, "http://your.awesome.url.com/payload"

To test if it works type:

    cap payload:deploy
    
The best way to test out is to use http://www.postbin.org/.

## Configuration options

- payload_url     &mdash; Primary URL where the data would be sent (required)
- payload_format  &mdash; Payload format. Must be one of :json (default), :form, :yaml, :xml
- payload_params  &mdash; Extra parameters to the request (api_key, etc.). *Note: extra parameters wont be added to the payload.*
- payload_prompt  &mdash; Ask for deployment comment. (default: true)

## Payload structure

Plugin will sent a payload in one of the formats (FORM, JSON, YAML, XML) data via POST method.

Here is an example data:

    {
      "capistrano": {
        "version": "2.6.0",
        "application": "foobar",
        "deployer": {
          "user": "username",
          "hostname": "localhost"
        },
        "timestamp": "2011-01-01 00:00:00 -0600",
        "source": {
          "branch": "master",
          "revision": "abcdef",
          "repository": "git@github.com:username/repo.git"
        },
        "action": "deploy",
        "message": "Comment"
      },
      "payload_version": "0.4.0"
    }

That's it. Ready to roll.
