# Capistrano Payload

Capistrano plugin that delivers JSON-encoded deployment information via POST to the URL of your choice.

## Installation

    gem install capistrano-payload
    
## Usage

Add payload plugin into your deploy.rb file:

    require 'capistrano-payload'
    
Then configure URL:

    set :payload_url, "http://your.awesome.url.com/payload"

To test if it works type:

    cap payload:deploy
    
The best way to test out is to use http://www.postbin.org/.

## Options

- payload_url     &mdash; Primary URL where the data would be sent (required)
- payload_format  &mdash; Payload format. Must be one of :json (default), :form, :yaml, :xml
- payload_params  &mdash; Extra parameters to the request (api_key, etc.). *Note: extra parameters wont be added to the payload.*
- payload_message &mdash; Ask for deployment comment. (default: true)

## Payload structure

Plugin will sent JSON-encoded data via POST method.

Here is the sample payload:

    {
      "capistrano": {
        "version": "2.6.0",
        "application": "APP_NAME",
        "deployer": {
          "user": "sosedoff",
          "hostname": "localhost",
        }
        "timestamp": "2011-07-21 19:09:52 -0500",
        "message": "Release 1.0.0", 
        "source": {
          "branch": "master",
          "revision": "b18ffa822c16c028765800d0c4d22bfd5e4f3bf9",
          "repository": "git@github.com:repository.git"
        },
        "action": "deploy"
      },
      "payload_version": "0.2.0"
    }

That's it. Ready to roll.
